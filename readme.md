### How To Use
First, download this repo (either by using ```git clone``` or ```git pull``` if you've already cloned it), or by downloading a release, or by just downloading this repo as a whole.

Second, you need the filesystem for New Super Mario Bros. U. You can get it by dumping the game using ddd: https://gbatemp.net/threads/ddd-wiiu-title-dumper.418492/

Thirdly, Download and install the following:
 * Python 3.4 (or newer) - http://www.python.org
 * PyQt 5.3 (or newer) - http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro
 * cx_Freeze 4.3 (or newer) (optional) - http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net  

Run the following in a command prompt:  
`python3 miyamoto.py`  
You can replace `python3` with the path to python.exe (including "python.exe" at the end) and `miyamoto.py` with the path to miyamoto.py (including "miyamoto.py" at the end)  
  
It should ask you to choose a folder. Choose the course_res_pack folder, or where you've stored the levels (1-1.szs, at least).

Enjoy.
