#NOTICE!!!
Since I'm a tool with Github, the releases will contain the acutal source code. So git clone will bring you something that will never work. Just unzip the source folder for each release.

# MiyamotoNext-NSMBU
A level editor for NSMBU and NSLU, based on Reggie! Next by RoadrunnerWMC, which is based on Reggie by Treeki, Tempus et al. Uses PyQt5, Python 3, TPLLib, and other libs.

# How To Use
First, download this repo (either by using ```git clone``` or ```git pull``` if you've already cloned it), or by downloading a release, or by just downloading this repo as a whole.

Second, you need the filesystem for New Super Mario Bros. U. We do not supply this due to copyright reasons, so obtain a copy by yourself through Google.

Thirdly, once you have the filesystem, run ```run-python34.bat``` (or run the EXE, if you're using a release) and on first run, it should ask you to choose a folder. Choose the course_res_pack folder, or where you've stored the levels.

Enjoy.
