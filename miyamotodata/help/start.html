            <h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>
                <p>Hello, and welcome to Miyamoto!</p>
                <p>You are probably thinking - "I'm 12 years old and fail at life, and I can't figure out how to use such a simple editor as Miyamoto! Where can I go to ask people all of my stupid questions since I can't figure out jack squat myself?"</p>
                <p>Fear not! You need not ask anyone, all your stupid, pathetic, worthless questions can be answered within this document. Continue to read and navigate through the red coloured links by clicking on them with the mouse pointer. If this proves too difficult, try operating <i>Miyamoto!</i> with your Mom.</p>
                <p><br></p>
            
            <h2><b>Extracting the Game's Files</b></h2>
                <p>To run Miyamoto, you'll need the course_res folder of the game. This is to prove you have a legal copy of the game.</p>
                <p>You can use ddd to extract the game's files. A good tutorial is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTWG_nUY1aM" <span="" class="s1">here</a>.
</p>
                <p>Once you have the games files, open Miyamoto and select the course_res folder. You can now load any level in the game!</p>
                
                <p><br></p>
            
            <h2><b>Starting Miyamoto!</b></h2>
                <p>If you have a precompiled executable, simply double click. Precompiled executables should be available as a Windows exe, a Mac app, or a Linux application made via cx_Freeze, pyinstaller, cython, or nuitka.</p>
                <p>For those who cannot run one of the available executable files, or who simply desire not to do so, there is a source distribution available. The source distribution requires the following packages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="s2"><a href="http://www.python.org/download/"><span class="s3">Python 3.4</span></a></span> or higher</li>
                    
                    
                    <li><a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download"><span class="s3">PyQt 5.3</span></a><span class="s4"> or higher</span></li>
                <li><p>Please Note: Linux and Mac users must have WINE installed!</p></li></ul>
                <p><b>Windows users</b> can get away with downloading the Windows binary installer for Python and the binary Installer for PyQt (first and last links), which will hold your hand and install Qt for you.</p>
                <p><b>Mac OS X Snow Leopard users</b> will need to buildPyQt for both architectures (i386 and x86_64). PyQt will also require a change to the configure.py file - the i386 line should specify x86_64 as well. If you have an older version of Qt, you will need to upgrade to the newest one, and it is strongly recommended you build with the development versions of PyQt.</p>
                <p><b>Linux users</b> must have PyQt5 install via  <i>sudo pip3 install pyqt5</i> and WINE by <i>sudo apt-get install wine</i> for Ubuntu distributions.</p>
                <p>If you have a different OS or a non-Ubuntu linux distribution, figure it out yourself.</p>
                <p>On the time of writing this, Miyamoto for 32 bit windows will not work, since puzzlehd and gtx_extract are 64 bit. There may be an older build named Miyamoto-SLOW that will work, but is probably very buggy in everything. It is also super slow as the name implies.
</p>
                
                <p><br></p>
            
            <h2><b>Creating New Levels</b></h2>
                <p>You still must open aany level in the editor before you can use the menu. To create a new level, simply select "New" from the file menu. A level must have at least one zone and one entrance (ID 0), otherwise the level will not work. You should also add tilesets by clicking "Edit Slot X Tileset").</p>
                <p><br></p>
            
            <h2><b>Opening Existing Files</b></h2>
                <p>Miyamoto! has two options for opening files.</p>
                <p>"Open Level by Name" produces a list of all levels in NSMBU, and allows you to choose from the list. This option is useful for getting a feel as to how to design your levels, and for looking up references.</p>
                <p>"Open Level by File" allows you to select a file from your hard drive and open it. This option will be used to select your works in progress, or to check out the creations of others. It supports both .szs and .sarc filetypes.</p>
                <p><br></p>
